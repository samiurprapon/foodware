## Data management
---
To Store data I used `MySQL` database. `MySQL` database is suitable and scalable for Management Applications. To solve business problems like Restaurant, cross platform might be needed for near future. So, I choose Relational Database to do the job. 

I used `ORM` instead of raw query. ORM has protection againts `SQL injection` by default. I found `sequelize` is the better `ORM` for node ecosystem. Using `sequelize` I also create tables.

To create routes, `express` is well known module for creating Backend application.

## Design Pattern
---

### Android
On client side I followed `MVC` architecture. But I used `singleton`, `adapter`, `memento` and `factory method` to improve the overall scenerio. Such as I choose `singleton` pattern to load `Fragment`, `Authentication`. Use `adapter` pattern to  load `recyclerview` data. 

### Server
Application backend server is built with `Nodejs` and `express`. Server side is developed using `MVC` Design Pattern. 



## Roadblocks
---
*Responsive UI* : Android's multiple screen size and ratio wa the first issue I faced. While porting the UI from Figma has a huge downside. Figma's generated Android code is not enough to implement in real application. Exporting `drawble` doesn't solve the porblem. I had to write boiler plate `XML` code for each drawbles. To reduce the number of drawable, I use built in drawbles such as `checkbox`, `selector` etc. 

*Android Emulator* : Android Device emulator is obselute for development. It is so juncky and sometime is stop working. After a certain period of time, Emulator shows a dialog box `System UI` stop working. I had to spend number of hours to fix my code and could find out the error later I found app works just fine on phone but on emulator it crashes. And Emulator issue couldn't be solve.

*Windows Ecosytem*: Windows is a piece of junk for development works. It restarts randomly. Update system without notifitying. Windows filesystem is worst we can think of. It creates issues with LF files. When I had no choice to change OS from Arch to Windows. I had to remove directory (e.g. `/.gitignore`). From nowhere stops MySQL server.  

*MySQL Server*: Choosing `Relational Database` instead of `Firebase` or `MongoDb` was a wrong decesion. Single handedly, working parallel on `Database Designning`, `API Documentaion`, `API integration` is huge mental pressure. At the same time, I face `windwos` issues. Fixing OS and server related issues killed most of the productive time. Using No-SQL database could reduce mental pressure and increase production.
